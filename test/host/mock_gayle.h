/*
 * Mock of the Amiga Gayle IDE port (A4000, A1200 and A600 flavours) with up
 * to two ATA-2 drives, for the host harness.  Addresses are absolute, exactly
 * as the driver issues them; the selected board decides which respond.
 *
 * Byte order model: a 16-bit DATA read returns (stream[0] << 8) | stream[1]
 * where `stream' is the byte sequence the drive puts on the 16-bit bus in
 * little-endian word order -- the WinUAE/Amiberry Gayle model (ide.cpp
 * ide_get_data_2), which is how sector bytes arrive in natural order on the
 * 68k and IDENTIFY words arrive swapped.
 *
 * Interrupts: the drive asserts INTRQ (mock_intrq) when nIEN is clear and a
 * sector is ready (READ), a sector was accepted (WRITE), or a command ends.
 * Reading STATUS drops it.  On the A4000 the Gayle status register mirrors it
 * live; on the A1200/A600 it is latched into INTREQ until acknowledged and
 * only reaches INT2 when INTENA bit 7 is set.  mock_int2_asserted() tells the
 * harness when the kernel's p2int would call the handlers.
